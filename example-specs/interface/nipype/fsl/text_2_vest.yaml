# ----
# 
#     Use FSL Text2Vest`https://web.mit.edu/fsl_v5.0.10/fsl/doc/wiki/GLM(2f)CreatingDesignMatricesByHand.html`_
#     to convert your plain text design matrix data into the format used by the FSL tools.
# 
#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces.fsl import Text2Vest
#     >>> t2v = Text2Vest()
#     >>> t2v.inputs.in_file = "design.txt"
#     >>> t2v.inputs.out_file = "design.mat"
#     >>> t2v.cmdline
#     'Text2Vest design.txt design.mat'
#     >>> res = t2v.run() # doctest: +SKIP
#
