#     Front-end for Avi Snyders image registration tool. Computes the
#     talairach transform that maps the input volume to the MNI average_305.
#     This does not add the xfm to the header of the input file. When called
#     by recon-all, the xfm is added to the header after the transform is
#     computed.
# 
#     Examples
#     ========
# 
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces.freesurfer import TalairachAVI
#     >>> example = TalairachAVI()
#     >>> example.inputs.in_file = 'norm.mgz'
#     >>> example.inputs.out_file = 'trans.mat'
#     >>> example.cmdline
#     'talairach_avi --i norm.mgz --xfm trans.mat'
# 
#     >>> example.run() # doctest: +SKIP
