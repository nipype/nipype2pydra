# 
#     This program projects (detrends) out various 'nuisance' time series from
#     each voxel in the input dataset.  Note that all the projections are done
#     via linear regression, including the frequency-based options such
#     as ``-passband``.  In this way, you can bandpass time-censored data, and at
#     the same time, remove other time series of no interest
#     (e.g., physiological estimates, motion parameters).
#     Shifts voxel time series from input so that separate slices are aligned to
#     the same temporal origin.
# 
#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import afni
#     >>> tproject = afni.TProject()
#     >>> tproject.inputs.in_file = 'functional.nii'
#     >>> tproject.inputs.bandpass = (0.00667, 99999)
#     >>> tproject.inputs.polort = 3
#     >>> tproject.inputs.automask = True
#     >>> tproject.inputs.out_file = 'projected.nii.gz'
#     >>> tproject.cmdline
#     '3dTproject -input functional.nii -automask -bandpass 0.00667 99999 -polort 3 -prefix projected.nii.gz'
#     >>> res = tproject.run()  # doctest: +SKIP

If you want separate projections   in each run, then you must either break these ort files   into appropriate components, OR you must run 3dTproject   for each run separately, using the appropriate pieces   from the ort files via the ``{...}`` selector for the   1D files and the ``[...]`` selector for the datasets.

Each string is of one of the following forms:  * ``37`` => remove global time index #37 * ``2:37`` => remove time index #37 in run #2 * ``37..47`` => remove global time indexes #37-47 * ``37-47`` => same as above * ``2:37..47`` => remove time indexes #37-47 in run #2 * ``*:0-2`` => remove time indexes #0-2 in all runs    * Time indexes within each run start at 0.   * Run indexes start at 1 (just be to confusing).   * N.B.: 2:37,47 means index #37 in run #2 and     global time index 47; it does NOT mean     index #37 in run #2 AND index #47 in run #2.  
    cenmode:
    # type=enum|default='KILL'|allowed['KILL','NTRP','ZERO']: Specifies how censored time points are treated in the output dataset:  * mode = ZERO -- put zero values in their place;   output dataset is same length as input * mode = KILL -- remove those time points;   output dataset is shorter than input * mode = NTRP -- censored values are replaced by interpolated   neighboring (in time) non-censored values,   BEFORE any projections, and then the   analysis proceeds without actual removal   of any time points -- this feature is to   keep the Spanish Inquisition happy. * The default mode is KILL !!!

    noblock:
    # type=bool|default=False: Also as in 3dDeconvolve, if you want the program to treat an auto-catenated dataset as one long run, use this option. However, '-noblock' will not affect catenation if you use the '-concat' option.

    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Remove each column in file. Each column will have its mean removed.

    dsort:
    # type=inputmultiobject|default=[]: Remove the 3D+time time series in dataset fset.  * That is, 'fset' contains a different nuisance time   series for each voxel (e.g., from AnatICOR). * Multiple -dsort options are allowed.

    # type=tuple|default=(0.0, 0.0): Remove all frequencies in the range
    TR:
    # type=float|default=0.0: Use time step dd for the frequency calculations, rather than the value stored in the dataset header.
