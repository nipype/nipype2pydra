# Computes center of mass using 3dCM command
# 
#     .. note::
# 
#       By default, the output is (x,y,z) values in DICOM coordinates. But
#       as of Dec, 2016, there are now command line switches for other options.
# 
# 
#     For complete details, see the `3dCM Documentation.
#     <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dCM.html>`_
# 
#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import afni
#     >>> cm = afni.CenterMass()
#     >>> cm.inputs.in_file = 'structural.nii'
#     >>> cm.inputs.cm_file = 'cm.txt'
#     >>> cm.inputs.roi_vals = [2, 10]
#     >>> cm.cmdline
#     '3dCM -roi_vals 2 10 structural.nii > cm.txt'
#     >>> res = 3dcm.run()  # doctest: +SKIP
