    fscale:
    # type=bool|default=False: Force scaling of the output to the maximum integer range.
    gscale:
    # type=bool|default=False: Same as '-fscale', but also forces each output sub-brick to to get the same scaling factor.
    nscale:
    # type=bool|default=False: Don't do any scaling on output to byte or short datasets.
    scale_floats:
    # type=float|default=0.0: Multiply input by VAL, but only if the input datum is float. This is needed when the input dataset has a small range, like 0 to 2.0 for instance. With such a range, very few edges are detected due to what I suspect to be truncation problems. Multiplying such a dataset by 10000 fixes the problem and the scaling is undone at the output.
