# Converts AFNI format files to NIFTI format. This can also convert 2D or
#     1D data, which you can numpy.squeeze() to remove extra dimensions.
# 
#     For complete details, see the `3dAFNItoNIFTI Documentation.
#     <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dAFNItoNIFTI.html>`_

#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import afni
#     >>> a2n = afni.AFNItoNIFTI()
#     >>> a2n.inputs.in_file = 'afni_output.3D'
#     >>> a2n.inputs.out_file =  'afni_output.nii'
#     >>> a2n.cmdline
#     '3dAFNItoNIFTI -prefix afni_output.nii afni_output.3D'
#     >>> res = a2n.run()  # doctest: +SKIP
