# ----
# Computes a quality index for each sub-brick in a 3D+time dataset.
#     The output is a 1D time series with the index for each sub-brick.
#     The results are written to stdout.
# 
#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import afni
#     >>> tqual = afni.QualityIndex()
#     >>> tqual.inputs.in_file = 'functional.nii'
#     >>> tqual.cmdline  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
#     '3dTqual functional.nii > functional_tqual'
#     >>> res = tqual.run()  # doctest: +SKIP
