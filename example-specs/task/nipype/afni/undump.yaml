# 3dUndump - Assembles a 3D dataset from an ASCII list of coordinates and
#     (optionally) values.
# 
#      The input file(s) are ASCII files, with one voxel specification per
#      line.  A voxel specification is 3 numbers (-ijk or -xyz coordinates),
#      with an optional 4th number giving the voxel value.  For example:
# 
#      1 2 3
#      3 2 1 5
#      5.3 6.2 3.7
#      // this line illustrates a comment
# 
#      The first line puts a voxel (with value given by '-dval') at point
#      (1,2,3).  The second line puts a voxel (with value 5) at point (3,2,1).
#      The third line puts a voxel (with value given by '-dval') at point
#      (5.3,6.2,3.7).  If -ijk is in effect, and fractional coordinates
#      are given, they will be rounded to the nearest integers; for example,
#      the third line would be equivalent to (i,j,k) = (5,6,4).
# 
#

    # type=float|default=0.0: radius in mm of the sphere that will be filled about each input (x,y,z) or (i,j,k) voxel. If the radius is not given, or is 0, then each input data line sets the value in only one voxel.
    orient:
    # type=tuple|default=('R', 'A', 'I'): Specifies the coordinate order used by -xyz. The code must be 3 letters, one each from the pairs {R,L} {A,P} {I,S}.  The first letter gives the orientation of the x-axis, the second the orientation of the y-axis, the third the z-axis: R = right-to-left         L = left-to-right A = anterior-to-posterior P = posterior-to-anterior I = inferior-to-superior  S = superior-to-inferior If -orient isn't used, then the coordinate order of the -master (in_file) dataset is used to interpret (x,y,z) inputs.
