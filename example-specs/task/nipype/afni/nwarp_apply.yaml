# Program to apply a nonlinear 3D warp saved from 3dQwarp
#     (or 3dNwarpCat, etc.) to a 3D dataset, to produce a warped
#     version of the source dataset.
# 
#     For complete details, see the `3dNwarpApply Documentation.
#     <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dNwarpApply.html>`_

#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import afni
#     >>> nwarp = afni.NwarpApply()
#     >>> nwarp.inputs.in_file = 'Fred+orig'
#     >>> nwarp.inputs.master = 'NWARP'
#     >>> nwarp.inputs.warp = "'Fred_WARP+tlrc Fred.Xaff12.1D'"
#     >>> nwarp.cmdline
#     "3dNwarpApply -source Fred+orig -interp wsinc5 -master NWARP -prefix Fred+orig_Nwarp -nwarp 'Fred_WARP+tlrc Fred.Xaff12.1D'"
#     >>> res = nwarp.run()  # doctest: +SKIP
