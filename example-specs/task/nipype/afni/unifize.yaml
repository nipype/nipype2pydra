# 3dUnifize - for uniformizing image intensity
# 
#     * The input dataset is supposed to be a T1-weighted volume,
#       possibly already skull-stripped (e.g., via 3dSkullStrip).
#       However, this program can be a useful step to take BEFORE
#       3dSkullStrip, since the latter program can fail if the input
#       volume is strongly shaded -- 3dUnifize will (mostly) remove
#       such shading artifacts.
# 
#     * The output dataset has the white matter (WM) intensity approximately
#       uniformized across space, and scaled to peak at about 1000.
# 
#     * The output dataset is always stored in float format!
# 
#     * If the input dataset has more than 1 sub-brick, only sub-brick
#       #0 will be processed!
# 
#     * Want to correct EPI datasets for nonuniformity?
#       You can try the new and experimental [Mar 2017] '-EPI' option.
# 
#     * The principal motive for this program is for use in an image
#       registration script, and it may or may not be useful otherwise.
# 
#     * This program replaces the older (and very different) 3dUniformize,
#       which is no longer maintained and may sublimate at any moment.
#       (In other words, we do not recommend the use of 3dUniformize.)
#

    out_file:
    # type=file: unifized file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: output image file name
    t2:
    # type=bool|default=False: Treat the input as if it were T2-weighted, rather than T1-weighted. This processing is done simply by inverting the image contrast, processing it as if that result were T1-weighted, and then re-inverting the results counts of voxel overlap, i.e., each voxel will contain the number of masks that it is set in.
    gm:
    # type=bool|default=False: Also scale to unifize 'gray matter' = lower intensity voxels (to aid in registering images from different scanners).
    urad:
    # type=float|default=0.0: Sets the radius (in voxels) of the ball used for the sneaky trick. Default value is 18.3, and should be changed proportionally if the dataset voxel size differs significantly from 1 mm.
    scale_file:
    # type=file: scale factor file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: output file name to save the scale factor used at each voxel 
    no_duplo:
    # type=bool|default=False: Do NOT use the 'duplo down' step; this can be useful for lower resolution datasets.
    epi:
    # type=bool|default=False: Assume the input dataset is a T2 (or T2\*) weighted EPI time series. After computing the scaling, apply it to ALL volumes (TRs) in the input dataset. That is, a given voxel will be scaled by the same factor at each TR. This option also implies '-noduplo' and '-T2'.This option turns off '-GM' if you turned it on.
    rbt:
    # type=tuple|default=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0): Option for AFNI experts only.Specify the 3 parameters for the algorithm: R = radius; same as given by option '-Urad', [default=18.3] b = bottom percentile of normalizing data range, [default=70.0] r = top percentile of normalizing data range, [default=80.0] 
    t2_up:
    # type=float|default=0.0: Option for AFNI experts only.Set the upper percentile point used for T2-T1 inversion. Allowed to be anything between 90 and 100 (inclusive), with default to 98.5  (for no good reason).
    cl_frac:
    # type=float|default=0.0: Option for AFNI experts only.Set the automask 'clip level fraction'. Must be between 0.1 and 0.9. A small fraction means to make the initial threshold for clipping (a la 3dClipLevel) smaller, which will tend to make the mask larger.  [default=0.1]
