# 
#     'mris_calc' is a simple calculator that operates on FreeSurfer
#     curvatures and volumes. In most cases, the calculator functions with
#     three arguments: two inputs and an <ACTION> linking them. Some
#     actions, however, operate with only one input <file1>. In all cases,
#     the first input <file1> is the name of a FreeSurfer curvature overlay
#     (e.g. rh.curv) or volume file (e.g. orig.mgz). For two inputs, the
#     calculator first assumes that the second input is a file. If, however,
#     this second input file doesn't exist, the calculator assumes it refers
#     to a float number, which is then processed according to <ACTION>.Note:
#     <file1> and <file2> should typically be generated on the same subject.
# 
#     Examples
#     ========
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces.freesurfer import MRIsCalc
#     >>> example = MRIsCalc()
#     >>> example.inputs.in_file1 = 'lh.area' # doctest: +SKIP
#     >>> example.inputs.in_file2 = 'lh.area.pial' # doctest: +SKIP
#     >>> example.inputs.action = 'add'
#     >>> example.inputs.out_file = 'area.mid'
#     >>> example.cmdline # doctest: +SKIP
#     'mris_calc -o lh.area.mid lh.area add lh.area.pial'
