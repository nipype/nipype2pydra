#     This program segments white matter from the input volume.  The input
#     volume should be normalized such that white matter voxels are
#     ~110-valued, and the volume is conformed to 256^3.
#

#     Examples
#     ========
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import freesurfer
#     >>> SegmentWM_node = freesurfer.SegmentWM()
#     >>> SegmentWM_node.inputs.in_file = "norm.mgz"
#     >>> SegmentWM_node.inputs.out_file = "wm.seg.mgz"
#     >>> SegmentWM_node.cmdline
#     'mri_segment norm.mgz wm.seg.mgz'
