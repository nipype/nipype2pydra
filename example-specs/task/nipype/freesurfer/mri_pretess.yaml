# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of

# ----
# 
#     Uses Freesurfer's mri_pretess to prepare volumes to be tessellated.
# 
#     Changes white matter (WM) segmentation so that the neighbors of all
#     voxels labeled as WM have a face in common - no edges or corners
#     allowed.
# 
#     Example
#     -------
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.freesurfer as fs
#     >>> pretess = fs.MRIPretess()
#     >>> pretess.inputs.in_filled = 'wm.mgz'
#     >>> pretess.inputs.in_norm = 'norm.mgz'
#     >>> pretess.inputs.nocorners = True
#     >>> pretess.cmdline
#     'mri_pretess -nocorners wm.mgz wm norm.mgz wm_pretesswm.mgz'
#     >>> pretess.run() # doctest: +SKIP
