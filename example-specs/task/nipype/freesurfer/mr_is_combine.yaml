# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of
# 'nipype.interfaces.freesurfer.utils.MRIsCombine' from Nipype to Pydra.

#
# Docs
# ----
# 
#     Uses Freesurfer's ``mris_convert`` to combine two surface files into one.
# 
#     For complete details, see the `mris_convert Documentation.
#     <https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mris_convert>`_
# 
#     If given an ``out_file`` that does not begin with ``'lh.'`` or ``'rh.'``,
#     ``mris_convert`` will prepend ``'lh.'`` to the file name.
#     To avoid this behavior, consider setting ``out_file = './<filename>'``, or
#     leaving out_file blank.
# 
#     In a Node/Workflow, ``out_file`` is interpreted literally.
# 
#     Example
#     -------
# 
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.freesurfer as fs
#     >>> mris = fs.MRIsCombine()
#     >>> mris.inputs.in_files = ['lh.pial', 'rh.pial']
#     >>> mris.inputs.out_file = 'bh.pial'
#     >>> mris.cmdline
#     'mris_convert --combinesurfs lh.pial rh.pial bh.pial'
#     >>> mris.run()  # doctest: +SKIP
