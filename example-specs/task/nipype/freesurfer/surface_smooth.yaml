# Smooth a surface image with mri_surf2surf.
# 
#     The surface is smoothed by an iterative process of averaging the
#     value at each vertex with those of its adjacent neighbors. You may supply
#     either the number of iterations to run or a desired effective FWHM of the
#     smoothing process.  If the latter, the underlying program will calculate
#     the correct number of iterations internally.

#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.freesurfer as fs
#     >>> smoother = fs.SurfaceSmooth()
#     >>> smoother.inputs.in_file = "lh.cope1.mgz"
#     >>> smoother.inputs.subject_id = "subj_1"
#     >>> smoother.inputs.hemi = "lh"
#     >>> smoother.inputs.fwhm = 5
#     >>> smoother.cmdline # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
#     'mri_surf2surf --cortex --fwhm 5.0000 --hemi lh --sval lh.cope1.mgz --tval ...lh.cope1_smooth5.mgz --s subj_1'
