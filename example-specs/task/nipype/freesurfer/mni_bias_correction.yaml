# Wrapper for nu_correct, a program from the Montreal Neurological Insitute (MNI)
#     used for correcting intensity non-uniformity (ie, bias fields). You must have the
#     MNI software installed on your system to run this. See [www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/software/N3]
#     for more info.
# 
#     mri_nu_correct.mni uses float internally instead of uchar. It also rescales the output so
#     that the global mean is the same as that of the input. These two changes are linked and
#     can be turned off with --no-float
# 
#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces.freesurfer import MNIBiasCorrection
#     >>> correct = MNIBiasCorrection()
#     >>> correct.inputs.in_file = "norm.mgz"
#     >>> correct.inputs.iterations = 6
#     >>> correct.inputs.protocol_iterations = 1000
#     >>> correct.inputs.distance = 50
#     >>> correct.cmdline
#     'mri_nu_correct.mni --distance 50 --i norm.mgz --n 6 --o norm_output.mgz --proto-iters 1000'

    iterations:

    # type=int|default=0: Passes Np as argument of the -iterations flag of nu_correct. This is different than the --n flag above. Default is not to pass nu_correct the -iterations flag.

    # type=int|default=0: N3 -distance option
