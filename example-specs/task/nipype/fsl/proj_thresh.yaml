# Use FSL proj_thresh for thresholding some outputs of probtrack
#     For complete details, see the FDT Documentation
#     <http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fdt/fdt_thresh.html>

#     Example

# 
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import fsl
#     >>> ldir = ['seeds_to_M1.nii', 'seeds_to_M2.nii']
#     >>> pThresh = fsl.ProjThresh(in_files=ldir, threshold=3)
#     >>> pThresh.cmdline
#     'proj_thresh seeds_to_M1.nii seeds_to_M2.nii 3'
