# Use fslcpgeom to copy the header geometry information to another image.
#     Copy certain parts of the header information (image dimensions, voxel
#     dimensions, voxel dimensions units string, image orientation/origin or
#     qform/sform info) from one image to another. Note that only copies from
#     Analyze to Analyze or Nifti to Nifti will work properly. Copying from
#     different files will result in loss of information or potentially incorrect
#     settings.

  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.

  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`

  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present

- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)

  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
