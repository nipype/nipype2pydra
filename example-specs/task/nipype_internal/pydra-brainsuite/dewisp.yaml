#     dewisp
#     removes wispy tendril structures from cortex model binary masks.
#     It does so based on graph theoretic analysis of connected components,
#     similar to TCA. Each branch of the structure graph is analyzed to determine
#     pinch points that indicate a likely error in segmentation that attaches noise
#     to the image. The pinch threshold determines how many voxels the cross-section
#     can be before it is considered part of the image.

  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,

  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)

  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields

  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)

    # type=file|default=<undefined>: input file

  # consisting of 'module', 'name', and optionally 'alias' keys
  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
