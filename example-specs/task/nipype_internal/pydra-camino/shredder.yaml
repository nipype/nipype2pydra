# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of

# ----
# 
#     Extracts periodic chunks from a data stream.
# 
#     Shredder makes an initial offset of offset bytes. It then reads and outputs
#     chunksize bytes, skips space bytes, and repeats until there is no more input.
# 
#     If  the  chunksize  is  negative, chunks of size chunksize are read and the
#     byte ordering of each chunk is reversed. The whole chunk will be reversed, so
#     the chunk must be the same size as the data type, otherwise the order of the
#     values in the chunk, as well as their endianness, will be reversed.
# 
#     Examples
#     --------
# 
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.camino as cam
#     >>> shred = cam.Shredder()
#     >>> shred.inputs.in_file = 'SubjectA.Bfloat'
#     >>> shred.inputs.offset = 0
#     >>> shred.inputs.chunksize = 1
#     >>> shred.inputs.space = 2
#     >>> shred.run()          # doctest: +SKIP
