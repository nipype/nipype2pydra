#     Use vtkstreamlines to convert raw or voxel format streamlines to VTK polydata

#     Examples

# 
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.camino as cmon
#     >>> vtk = cmon.VtkStreamlines()
#     >>> vtk.inputs.in_file = 'tract_data.Bfloat'
#     >>> vtk.inputs.voxeldims = [1,1,1]
#     >>> vtk.run()          # doctest: +SKIP
