# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of

# ----
# 
#     This program computes voxelwise statistics on a series of 3D images. The images
#     must be in the same space; the operation is performed voxelwise and one output
#     is produced per voxel.
# 
#     Examples
#     --------
# 
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.camino as cam
#     >>> imstats = cam.ImageStats()
#     >>> imstats.inputs.in_files = ['im1.nii','im2.nii','im3.nii']
#     >>> imstats.inputs.stat = 'max'
#     >>> imstats.run()          # doctest: +SKIP

inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
    in_files: generic/file+list-of
    # type=inputmultiobject|default=[]: List of images to process. They must be in the same space and have the same dimensions.
    output_root: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Filename root prepended onto the names of the output  files. The extension will be determined from the input.
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
outputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred

    out_file: generic/file
    # type=file: Path of the file computed with the statistic chosen
  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)
    in_files:
    # type=inputmultiobject|default=[]: List of images to process. They must be in the same space and have the same dimensions.
    stat:
    # type=enum|default='min'|allowed['max','mean','median','min','std','sum','var']: The statistic to compute.
    out_type:
    # type=enum|default='float'|allowed['char','double','float','int','long','short']: A Camino data type string, default is "float". Type must be signed.
    output_root:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Filename root prepended onto the names of the output  files. The extension will be determined from the input.
    args:
    # type=str|default='': Additional parameters to the command
    environ:
    # type=dict|default={}: Environment variables
  imports:
  # list[nipype2pydra.task.base.importstatement] - list import statements required by the test, with each list item
  # consisting of 'module', 'name', and optionally 'alias' keys
  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
