# title: Simple Region Growing Segmentation
# 
#     category: Segmentation
# 
#     description: A simple region growing segmentation algorithm based on intensity statistics. To create a list of fiducials (Seeds) for this algorithm, click on the tool bar icon of an arrow pointing to a starburst fiducial to enter the 'place a new object mode' and then use the fiducials module. This module uses the Slicer Command Line Interface (CLI) and the ITK filters CurvatureFlowImageFilter and ConfidenceConnectedImageFilter.

inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
    inputVolume: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Input volume to be filtered
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
outputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,

    outputVolume: generic/file
    # type=file: Output filtered
    # type=traitcompound|default=None: Output filtered
  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)
    smoothingIterations:
    # type=int|default=0: Number of smoothing iterations
    timestep:
    # type=float|default=0.0: Timestep for curvature flow
    iterations:
    # type=int|default=0: Number of iterations of region growing
    multiplier:
    # type=float|default=0.0: Number of standard deviations to include in intensity model
    neighborhood:
    # type=int|default=0: The radius of the neighborhood over which to calculate intensity model
    labelvalue:
    # type=int|default=0: The integer value (0-255) to use for the segmentation results. This will determine the color of the segmentation that will be generated by the Region growing algorithm
    seed:
    # type=inputmultiobject|default=[]: Seed point(s) for region growing
    inputVolume:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Input volume to be filtered
    outputVolume:
    # type=file: Output filtered
    # type=traitcompound|default=None: Output filtered
    args:
    # type=str|default='': Additional parameters to the command
    environ:
    # type=dict|default={}: Environment variables
  imports:
  # list[nipype2pydra.task.base.importstatement] - list import statements required by the test, with each list item
  # consisting of 'module', 'name', and optionally 'alias' keys
  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
