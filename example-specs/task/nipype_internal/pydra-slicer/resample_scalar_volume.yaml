# title: Resample Scalar Volume
# 
#     category: Legacy.Filtering
# 
#     description: Resampling an image is an important task in image analysis. It is especially important in the frame of image registration. This module implements image resampling through the use of itk Transforms. This module uses an Identity Transform. The resampling is controlled by the Output Spacing. "Resampling" is performed in space coordinates, not pixel/grid coordinates. It is quite important to ensure that image spacing is properly set on the images involved. The interpolator is required since the mapping from one space to the other will often require evaluation of the intensity of the image at non-grid positions. Several interpolators are available: linear, nearest neighbor, bspline and five flavors of sinc. The sinc interpolators, although more precise, are much slower than the linear and nearest neighbor interpolator. To resample label volumnes, nearest neighbor interpolation should be used exclusively.

inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
    InputVolume: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Input volume to be resampled
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
outputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface

  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)
    spacing:
    # type=inputmultiobject|default=[]: Spacing along each dimension (0 means use input spacing)
    interpolation:
    # type=enum|default='linear'|allowed['blackman','bspline','cosine','hamming','lanczos','linear','nearestNeighbor','welch']: Sampling algorithm (linear, nearest neighbor, bspline(cubic)  or windowed sinc). There are several sinc algorithms available as described in the following publication: Erik H. W. Meijering, Wiro J. Niessen, Josien P. W. Pluim, Max A. Viergever: Quantitative Comparison of Sinc-Approximating Kernels for Medical Image Interpolation. MICCAI 1999, pp. 210-217. Each window has a radius of 3;

  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
