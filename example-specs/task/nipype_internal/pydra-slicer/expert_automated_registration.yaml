inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
    fixedImage: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Image which defines the space into which the moving image is registered
    movingImage: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: The transform goes from the fixed image's space into the moving image's space
    loadTransform: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Load a transform that is immediately applied to the moving image
    fixedImageMask: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Image which defines a mask for the fixed image
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
