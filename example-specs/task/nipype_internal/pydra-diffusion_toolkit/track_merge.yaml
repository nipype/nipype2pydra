# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of

# ----
# 
#     Merges several TrackVis track files into a single track
#     file.
# 
#     An id type property tag is added to each track in the
#     newly merged file, with each unique id representing where
#     the track was originally from. When the merged file is
#     loaded in TrackVis, a property filter will show up in
#     Track Property panel. Users can adjust that to distinguish
#     and sub-group tracks by its id (origin).
# 
#     Example
#     -------
# 
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.diffusion_toolkit as dtk
#     >>> mrg = dtk.TrackMerge()
#     >>> mrg.inputs.track_files = ['track1.trk','track2.trk']
#     >>> mrg.run()                         # doctest: +SKIP
