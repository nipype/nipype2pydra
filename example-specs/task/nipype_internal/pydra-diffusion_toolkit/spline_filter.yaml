# 
#     Smoothes TrackVis track files with a B-Spline filter.
# 
#     Helps remove redundant track points and segments
#     (thus reducing the size of the track file) and also
#     make tracks nicely smoothed. It will NOT change the
#     quality of the tracks or lose any original information.
# 
#     Example
#     -------
# 
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.diffusion_toolkit as dtk
#     >>> filt = dtk.SplineFilter()
#     >>> filt.inputs.track_file = 'tracks.trk'
#     >>> filt.inputs.step_length = 0.5
#     >>> filt.run()                         # doctest: +SKIP
