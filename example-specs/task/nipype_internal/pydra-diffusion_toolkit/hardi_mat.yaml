# Use hardi_mat to calculate a reconstruction matrix from a gradient table
task_name: HARDIMat
nipype_name: HARDIMat
nipype_module: nipype.interfaces.diffusion_toolkit.odf
inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
    bvecs: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: b vectors file
    bvals: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: b values file
    out_file: generic/file
    # type=file: output matrix file
    # type=file|default='recon_mat.dat': output matrix file
    odf_file: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Filename that contains the reconstruction points on a HEMI-sphere. Use the pre-set 181 points by default
    reference_file: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Provide a dicom or nifti image as the reference for the program to figure out the image orientation information. if no such info was found in the given image header, the next 5 options -info, etc., will be used if provided. if image orientation info can be found in the given reference, all other 5 image orientation options will be IGNORED
    image_info: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: specify image information file. the image info file is generated from original dicom image by diff_unpack program and contains image orientation and other information needed for reconstruction and tracking. by default will look into the image folder for .info file
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
outputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred

    out_file: generic/file
    # type=file: output matrix file
    # type=file|default='recon_mat.dat': output matrix file
  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)
    bvecs:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: b vectors file
    bvals:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: b values file
    out_file:
    # type=file: output matrix file
    # type=file|default='recon_mat.dat': output matrix file
    order:
    # type=int|default=0: maximum order of spherical harmonics. must be even number. default is 4
    odf_file:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Filename that contains the reconstruction points on a HEMI-sphere. Use the pre-set 181 points by default
    reference_file:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Provide a dicom or nifti image as the reference for the program to figure out the image orientation information. if no such info was found in the given image header, the next 5 options -info, etc., will be used if provided. if image orientation info can be found in the given reference, all other 5 image orientation options will be IGNORED
    image_info:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: specify image information file. the image info file is generated from original dicom image by diff_unpack program and contains image orientation and other information needed for reconstruction and tracking. by default will look into the image folder for .info file
    image_orientation_vectors:
    # type=list|default=[]: specify image orientation vectors. if just one argument given, will treat it as filename and read the orientation vectors from the file. if 6 arguments are given, will treat them as 6 float numbers and construct the 1st and 2nd vector and calculate the 3rd one automatically. this information will be used to determine image orientation, as well as to adjust gradient vectors with oblique angle when
    oblique_correction:
    # type=bool|default=False: when oblique angle(s) applied, some SIEMENS dti protocols do not adjust gradient accordingly, thus it requires adjustment for correct diffusion tensor calculation
    args:
    # type=str|default='': Additional parameters to the command
    environ:
    # type=dict|default={}: Environment variables
  imports:
  # list[nipype2pydra.task.base.importstatement] - list import statements required by the test, with each list item
  # consisting of 'module', 'name', and optionally 'alias' keys
  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
