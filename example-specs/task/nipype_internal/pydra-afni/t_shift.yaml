# Shifts voxel time series from input so that separate slices are aligned
#     to the same temporal origin.
# 
#     For complete details, see the `3dTshift Documentation.
#     <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dTshift.html>`_
# 
#     Examples
#     --------
#     Slice timing details may be specified explicitly via the ``slice_timing``
#     input:
# 
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import afni
#     >>> TR = 2.5
#     >>> tshift = afni.TShift()
#     >>> tshift.inputs.in_file = 'functional.nii'
#     >>> tshift.inputs.tzero = 0.0
#     >>> tshift.inputs.tr = '%.1fs' % TR
#     >>> tshift.inputs.slice_timing = list(np.arange(40) / TR)
#     >>> tshift.cmdline
#     '3dTshift -prefix functional_tshift -tpattern @slice_timing.1D -TR 2.5s -tzero 0.0 functional.nii'
# 
#     When the ``slice_timing`` input is used, the ``timing_file`` output is populated,
#     in this case with the generated file.
# 
#     >>> tshift._list_outputs()['timing_file']  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
#     '.../slice_timing.1D'
# 
#     >>> np.loadtxt(tshift._list_outputs()['timing_file']).tolist()[:5]
#     [0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6]
# 
#     If ``slice_encoding_direction`` is set to ``'k-'``, the slice timing is reversed:
# 
#     >>> tshift.inputs.slice_encoding_direction = 'k-'
#     >>> tshift.cmdline
#     '3dTshift -prefix functional_tshift -tpattern @slice_timing.1D -TR 2.5s -tzero 0.0 functional.nii'
#     >>> np.loadtxt(tshift._list_outputs()['timing_file']).tolist()[:5]
#     [15.6, 15.2, 14.8, 14.4, 14.0]
# 
#     This method creates a ``slice_timing.1D`` file to be passed to ``3dTshift``.
#     A pre-existing slice-timing file may be used in the same way:
# 
#     >>> tshift = afni.TShift()
#     >>> tshift.inputs.in_file = 'functional.nii'
#     >>> tshift.inputs.tzero = 0.0
#     >>> tshift.inputs.tr = '%.1fs' % TR
#     >>> tshift.inputs.slice_timing = 'slice_timing.1D'
#     >>> tshift.cmdline
#     '3dTshift -prefix functional_tshift -tpattern @slice_timing.1D -TR 2.5s -tzero 0.0 functional.nii'
# 
#     When a pre-existing file is provided, ``timing_file`` is simply passed through.
# 
#     >>> tshift._list_outputs()['timing_file']  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
#     '.../slice_timing.1D'
# 
#     Alternatively, pre-specified slice timing patterns may be specified with the
#     ``tpattern`` input.
#     For example, to specify an alternating, ascending slice timing pattern:
# 
#     >>> tshift = afni.TShift()
#     >>> tshift.inputs.in_file = 'functional.nii'
#     >>> tshift.inputs.tzero = 0.0
#     >>> tshift.inputs.tr = '%.1fs' % TR
#     >>> tshift.inputs.tpattern = 'alt+z'
#     >>> tshift.cmdline
#     '3dTshift -prefix functional_tshift -tpattern alt+z -TR 2.5s -tzero 0.0 functional.nii'
# 
#     For backwards compatibility, ``tpattern`` may also take filenames prefixed
#     with ``@``.
#     However, in this case, filenames are not validated, so this usage will be
#     deprecated in future versions of Nipype.
# 
#     >>> tshift = afni.TShift()
#     >>> tshift.inputs.in_file = 'functional.nii'
#     >>> tshift.inputs.tzero = 0.0
#     >>> tshift.inputs.tr = '%.1fs' % TR
#     >>> tshift.inputs.tpattern = '@slice_timing.1D'
#     >>> tshift.cmdline
#     '3dTshift -prefix functional_tshift -tpattern @slice_timing.1D -TR 2.5s -tzero 0.0 functional.nii'
# 
#     In these cases, ``timing_file`` is undefined.
# 
#     >>> tshift._list_outputs()['timing_file']  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
#     <undefined>
# 
#     In any configuration, the interface may be run as usual:
# 
#     >>> res = tshift.run()  # doctest: +SKIP
#
