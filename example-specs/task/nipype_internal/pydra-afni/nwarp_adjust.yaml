# This program takes as input a bunch of 3D warps, averages them,
#     and computes the inverse of this average warp.  It then composes
#     each input warp with this inverse average to 'adjust' the set of
#     warps.  Optionally, it can also read in a set of 1-brick datasets
#     corresponding to the input warps, and warp each of them, and average
#     those.
# 
#     For complete details, see the `3dNwarpAdjust Documentation.

#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import afni
#     >>> adjust = afni.NwarpAdjust()
#     >>> adjust.inputs.warps = ['func2anat_InverseWarp.nii.gz', 'func2anat_InverseWarp.nii.gz', 'func2anat_InverseWarp.nii.gz', 'func2anat_InverseWarp.nii.gz', 'func2anat_InverseWarp.nii.gz']
#     >>> adjust.cmdline
#     '3dNwarpAdjust -nwarp func2anat_InverseWarp.nii.gz func2anat_InverseWarp.nii.gz func2anat_InverseWarp.nii.gz func2anat_InverseWarp.nii.gz func2anat_InverseWarp.nii.gz'
