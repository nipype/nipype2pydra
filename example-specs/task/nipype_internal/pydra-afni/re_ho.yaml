  metadata:

  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)
    in_file:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: input dataset
    out_file:
    # type=file: Voxelwise regional homogeneity map
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Output dataset.
    chi_sq:
    # type=bool|default=False: Output the Friedman chi-squared value in addition to the Kendall's W. This option is currently compatible only with the AFNI (BRIK/HEAD) output type; the chi-squared value will be the second sub-brick of the output dataset.
    mask_file:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Mask within which ReHo should be calculated voxelwise
    neighborhood:
    # type=enum|default='faces'|allowed['edges','faces','vertices']:  voxels in neighborhood. can be: ``faces`` (for voxel and 6 facewise neighbors, only), ``edges`` (for voxel and 18 face- and edge-wise neighbors), ``vertices`` (for voxel and 26 face-, edge-, and node-wise neighbors).
    sphere:
    # type=float|default=0.0: \ For additional voxelwise neighborhood control, the radius R of a desired neighborhood can be put in; R is a floating point number, and must be >1. Examples of the numbers of voxels in a given radius are as follows (you can roughly approximate with the ol' :math:`4\pi\,R^3/3` thing):      * R=2.0 -> V=33     * R=2.3 -> V=57,     * R=2.9 -> V=93,     * R=3.1 -> V=123,     * R=3.9 -> V=251,     * R=4.5 -> V=389,     * R=6.1 -> V=949,  but you can choose most any value.
    ellipsoid:
    # type=tuple|default=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0): \ Tuple indicating the x, y, and z radius of an ellipsoid defining the neighbourhood of each voxel. The 'hood is then made according to the following relation: :math:`(i/A)^2 + (j/B)^2 + (k/C)^2 \le 1.` which will have approx. :math:`V=4 \pi \, A B C/3`. The impetus for this freedom was for use with data having anisotropic voxel edge lengths.
    label_set:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: a set of ROIs, each labelled with distinct integers. ReHo will then be calculated per ROI.
