#     Use ``transformix`` to apply a transform on an input image.
#     The transform is specified in the transform-parameter file.
# 
#     Example
#     -------
# 
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces.elastix import ApplyWarp
#     >>> reg = ApplyWarp()
#     >>> reg.inputs.moving_image = 'moving1.nii'
#     >>> reg.inputs.transform_file = 'TransformParameters.0.txt'
#     >>> reg.cmdline
#     'transformix -in moving1.nii -threads 1 -out ./ -tp TransformParameters.0.txt'
