# title: Tensor Estimation
# 
#     category: Diffusion.GTRACT
# 
#     description: This step will convert a b-value averaged diffusion tensor image to a 3x3 tensor voxel image. This step takes the diffusion tensor image data and generates a tensor representation of the data based on the signal intensity decay, b values applied, and the diffusion difrections. The apparent diffusion coefficient for a given orientation is computed on a pixel-by-pixel basis by fitting the image data (voxel intensities) to the Stejskal-Tanner equation. If at least 6 diffusion directions are used, then the diffusion tensor can be computed. This program uses itk::DiffusionTensor3DReconstructionImageFilter. The user can adjust background threshold, median filter, and isotropic resampling.

inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
    inputVolume: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Required: input image 4D NRRD image. Must contain data based on at least 6 distinct diffusion directions. The inputVolume is allowed to have multiple b0 and gradient direction images. Averaging of the b0 image is done internally in this step. Prior averaging of the DWIs is not required.
    maskVolume: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Mask Image, if maskProcessingMode is ROI
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
outputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface

    outputVolume: generic/file
    # type=file: Required: name of output NRRD file containing the Tensor vector image
    # type=traitcompound|default=None: Required: name of output NRRD file containing the Tensor vector image
  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)
    inputVolume:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Required: input image 4D NRRD image. Must contain data based on at least 6 distinct diffusion directions. The inputVolume is allowed to have multiple b0 and gradient direction images. Averaging of the b0 image is done internally in this step. Prior averaging of the DWIs is not required.

    medianFilterSize:
    # type=inputmultiobject|default=[]: Median filter radius in all 3 directions
    maskProcessingMode:
    # type=enum|default='NOMASK'|allowed['NOMASK','ROI','ROIAUTO']: ROIAUTO:  mask is implicitly defined using a otsu foreground and hole filling algorithm. ROI: Uses the masks to define what parts of the image should be used for computing the transform. NOMASK: no mask used
    maskVolume:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Mask Image, if maskProcessingMode is ROI
    backgroundSuppressingThreshold:
    # type=int|default=0: Image threshold to suppress background. This sets a threshold used on the b0 image to remove background voxels from processing. Typically, values of 100 and 500 work well for Siemens and GE DTI data, respectively. Check your data particularly in the globus pallidus to make sure the brain tissue is not being eliminated with this threshold.
    resampleIsotropic:
    # type=bool|default=False: Flag to resample to isotropic voxels. Enabling this feature is recommended if fiber tracking will be performed.
    size:
    # type=float|default=0.0: Isotropic voxel size to resample to
    b0Index:
    # type=int|default=0: Index in input vector index to extract
    applyMeasurementFrame:
    # type=bool|default=False: Flag to apply the measurement frame to the gradient directions
    ignoreIndex:
    # type=inputmultiobject|default=[]: Ignore diffusion gradient index. Used to remove specific gradient directions with artifacts.
    numberOfThreads:
    # type=int|default=0: Explicitly specify the maximum number of threads to use.
    args:
    # type=str|default='': Additional parameters to the command
    environ:
    # type=dict|default={}: Environment variables
  imports:
  # list[nipype2pydra.task.base.importstatement] - list import statements required by the test, with each list item
  # consisting of 'module', 'name', and optionally 'alias' keys
  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
