  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.

  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`

  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present

- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation

    # type=float|default=0.0: Controls the smoothness of the resulting mask, small number are more smooth, large numbers allow more sharp corners.  
    initialModelIsovalue:
    # type=float|default=0.0: The identification of the input model iso-surface.  (for a binary image with 0s and 1s use 0.5) (for a binary image with 0s and 255's use 127.5).

  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)

  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
