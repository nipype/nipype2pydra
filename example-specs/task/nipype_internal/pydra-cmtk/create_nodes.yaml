#     Generates a NetworkX graph containing nodes at the centroid of each region in the input ROI file.
#     Node data is added from the resolution network file.
# 
#     Example
#     -------
# 
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.cmtk as cmtk
#     >>> mknode = cmtk.CreateNodes()
#     >>> mknode.inputs.roi_file = 'ROI_scale500.nii.gz'
#     >>> mknode.run() # doctest: +SKIP

inputs:
  omit:

  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.

    # type=file|default='nodenetwork.pck': Output gpickled network with the nodes defined.
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)

    # type=file: Output gpickled network with the nodes defined.
  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)

    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Region of interest file

    out_filename:
    # type=file|default='nodenetwork.pck': Output gpickled network with the nodes defined.
  imports:
  # list[nipype2pydra.task.base.importstatement] - list import statements required by the test, with each list item
  # consisting of 'module', 'name', and optionally 'alias' keys
  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
