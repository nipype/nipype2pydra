# Subdivides segmented ROI file into smaller subregions
# 
#     This interface implements the same procedure as in the ConnectomeMapper's
#     parcellation stage (cmp/stages/parcellation/maskcreation.py) for a single
#     parcellation scheme (e.g. 'scale500').
# 
#     Example
#     -------
# 
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.cmtk as cmtk
#     >>> parcellate = cmtk.Parcellate()
#     >>> parcellate.inputs.freesurfer_dir = '.'
#     >>> parcellate.inputs.subjects_dir = '.'
#     >>> parcellate.inputs.subject_id = 'subj1'
#     >>> parcellate.inputs.dilation = True
#     >>> parcellate.inputs.parcellation_name = 'scale500'
#     >>> parcellate.run()         # doctest: +SKIP
#
