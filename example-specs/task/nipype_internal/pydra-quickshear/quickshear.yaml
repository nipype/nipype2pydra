#     Quickshear is a simple geometric defacing algorithm
# 
#     Given an anatomical image and a reasonable brainmask, Quickshear estimates
#     a shearing plane with the brain mask on one side and the face on the other,
#     zeroing out the face side.
# 
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces.quickshear import Quickshear
#     >>> qs = Quickshear(in_file='T1.nii', mask_file='brain_mask.nii')
#     >>> qs.cmdline
#     'quickshear T1.nii brain_mask.nii T1_defaced.nii'
# 
#     In the absence of a precomputed mask, a simple pipeline can be generated
#     with any tool that generates brain masks:
# 
#     >>> from nipype.pipeline import engine as pe
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces import utility as niu
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces.fsl import BET
#     >>> deface_wf = pe.Workflow('deface_wf')
#     >>> inputnode = pe.Node(niu.IdentityInterface(['in_file']),
#     ...                     name='inputnode')
#     >>> outputnode = pe.Node(niu.IdentityInterface(['out_file']),
#     ...                      name='outputnode')
#     >>> bet = pe.Node(BET(mask=True), name='bet')
#     >>> quickshear = pe.Node(Quickshear(), name='quickshear')
#     >>> deface_wf.connect([
#     ...     (inputnode, bet, [('in_file', 'in_file')]),
#     ...     (inputnode, quickshear, [('in_file', 'in_file')]),
#     ...     (bet, quickshear, [('mask_file', 'mask_file')]),
#     ...     (quickshear, outputnode, [('out_file', 'out_file')]),
#     ...     ])
#     >>> inputnode.inputs.in_file = 'T1.nii'
#     >>> res = deface_wf.run()  # doctest: +SKIP
