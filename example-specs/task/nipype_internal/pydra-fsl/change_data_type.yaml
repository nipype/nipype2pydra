# Use fslmaths to change the datatype of an image.
task_name: ChangeDataType
nipype_name: ChangeDataType
nipype_module: nipype.interfaces.fsl.maths
inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
    in_file: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: image to operate on
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
outputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred

    out_file: generic/file
    # type=file: image written after calculations
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: image to write
  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
    out_file: out_file
    # type=file: image written after calculations
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: image to write
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)
    output_datatype:
    # type=enum|default='float'|allowed['char','double','float','input','int','short']: output data type
    in_file:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: image to operate on
    out_file:
    # type=file: image written after calculations
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: image to write
    internal_datatype:
    # type=enum|default='float'|allowed['char','double','float','input','int','short']: datatype to use for calculations (default is float)
    nan2zeros:
    # type=bool|default=False: change NaNs to zeros before doing anything
    output_type:
    # type=enum|default='NIFTI'|allowed['NIFTI','NIFTI_GZ','NIFTI_PAIR','NIFTI_PAIR_GZ']: FSL output type
    args:
    # type=str|default='': Additional parameters to the command
    environ:
    # type=dict|default={}: Environment variables
  imports:
  # list[nipype2pydra.task.base.importstatement] - list import statements required by the test, with each list item
  # consisting of 'module', 'name', and optionally 'alias' keys
  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
