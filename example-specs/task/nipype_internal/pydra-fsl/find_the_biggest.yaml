#     Use FSL find_the_biggest for performing hard segmentation on
#     the outputs of connectivity-based thresholding in probtrack.
#     For complete details, see the `FDT
#     Documentation. <http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fdt/fdt_biggest.html>`_

#     >>> fBig = fsl.FindTheBiggest(in_files=ldir, out_file='biggestSegmentation')
