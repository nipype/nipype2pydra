# Interface for executable reg_measure from NiftyReg platform.

#     Given two input images, compute the specified measure(s) of similarity

#     >>> node.inputs.flo_file = 'im2.nii'
#     >>> node.inputs.measure_type = 'lncc'
#     >>> node.inputs.omp_core_val = 4
#     >>> node.cmdline
#     'reg_measure -flo im2.nii -lncc -omp 4 -out im2_lncc.txt -ref im1.nii'
