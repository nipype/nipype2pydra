#     Computes the time-course SNR for a time series
# 
#     Typically you want to run this on a realigned time-series.
# 
#     Example
#     -------
#     >>> tsnr = TSNR()
#     >>> tsnr.inputs.in_file = 'functional.nii'
#     >>> res = tsnr.run() # doctest: +SKIP

  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
