Nipype2Pydra is a command-line tool for semi-automatically porting command interfaces
and workflows written from the Nipype_ workflow engine to its successor Pydra_. It has
been designed so that any required manual-specifications are stored in separate YAML
specification files, which is read ahead of the conversion, so once designed the
conversion can be re-run to pick up changes in newer versions of the Nipype_ code without
having to redo the manual steps.


Basic Usage
-----------

To convert a Nipype_ interface to a Pydra_ task run the `nipype2pydra task` command and
pass it the conversion specification YAML file and the root of the package to save the
generated module, e.g.::

    $ nipype2pydra task ants_registration_registration.yaml /path/to/package/root

This will create a module file under the package root directory based on the `output_module`
field in the specification, e.g::
    
    /path/to/package/root/output/module/path

If that is missing and the nipype interface is in the standard `nipype.interfaces`
package, then it will be stored at `pydra.tasks.` with the same path end.

Conversion Specifications
-------------------------

While the conversions aim to as automatic as possible, there are structural
differences between Nipype_ and Pydra_ that require manual specification, and it might
be desirable to rename some of the inputs/outputs to more intuitive names. Such
specifications are stored in YAML_ format, such as the ANTs registration conversion
specification,

.. code-block:: yaml

    task_name: n4_bias_field_correction
    nipype_name: N4BiasFieldCorrection
    nipype_module: nipype.interfaces.ants.segmentation
    inputs:
        omit:
        # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
        rename:
        # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
        types:
        # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
        # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
        # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
        # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
        # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
            input_image: medimage/nifti1
            mask_image: medimage/nifti1
            weight_image: medimage/nifti1
            bias_image: medimage/nifti1
        metadata:
        # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
    outputs:
        omit:
        # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
        rename:
        # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
        types:
        # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
        # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
        # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
        # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
        # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
            output_image: medimage/nifti1
            bias_image: medimage/nifti1
        callables:
        # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
        # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
        templates:
        # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
        requirements:
        # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
